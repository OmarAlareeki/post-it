## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

```

- Project Overview and Concept
Drawing inspiration from the UX of apps like OfferUp and LetGo, Post-It aims to give the user a way to find and sell goods.


- The Post-It Project’s mission is to enable a hyper-local gift economy, in order to curb needless consumption, engender human connection, and promote sustainability.

- Our app contributes to this mission by making the experience of offering and accepting goods as safe and friction-free as possible.
Minimum Viable Product

- User stories:
Since this is essentially a two-sided marketplace, we have two User personas, Listers (the “sellers”) and Searchers (“buyers”). (An interesting wrinkle here is that in some sense the Listers are themselves receiving a service—probing that may bear fruit.)

    As a Lister, In order to keep my life clutter-free as easily as possible, I want to snap a photo of things I want to be rid of and have someone come pick it up to take it away.

    As a Lister, I want to provides my services to the community as a way to hone my skills, connect with people as well as giving back to the community.

    As a Searcher, In order to fill a specific need, I want to easily see listings for free items and details relevant to making a decision to invest the time into picking it up.
